DESCRIPTION
    Diff::LibXDiff is a binding of LibXDiff
    (<http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html>) to Perl via XS

    LibXDiff is the basis of the diff-engine for git

    Currently only the "diff" method is supported, and that only with text
    diffing. More coming soon.

METHODS
$diff = Diff::LibXDiff->diff( $string1, $string2 )
    Calculate the textual diff of $string1 and $string2 and return the
    result as a string
